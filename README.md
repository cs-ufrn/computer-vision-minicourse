# Minicourse on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are presented in detail, 
from both the viewpoints of Mathematics and Data Science.
In the former, the overall operation is given in terms
of the Gradient Descent and Backpropagation algorithms,
which are explained and implemented from scratch. 
The second viewpoint presents the usage of some 
Python libraries which implement this kind
of ANN.

All explanations and implementations are given in 
Jupyter Notebooks.

## Experiences

- Minicourse on Introduction to Computer Vision (04/05/2018)

  To be presented by Vitor, Vinicius and Artur. The Minicourse on Introduction to Computer Vision
  aims to present
  the field of Computer Vision focusing on neural techniques for classification. Subjects
  range from Digital Image Processing with OpenCV
  to Convolutional Neural Networks. The third part (of five) of it is this minicourse on MLPs.
